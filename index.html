    <h1 class="display-4">Untitled C++ based rhythm game</h1>
    <p class="lead">A project made for Tredu in 2022-2023.
      <br/>Made using SDL2 and SDL_GPU, made within a few months without any prior experience in C++.
      <br/>The game is a rhythm game, where the player has to hit the correct notes at the correct time. 
      <br/><br/>I did not have a lot of time to implement all the features I wanted, but I am still proud of the result.
      <br/>Game is also surprisingly well optimized, although for some reason struggles on NVIDIA GPUs.

    <p class="lead">A project I made 3 years ago on my free time. 
      <br/>The project showcases your GPU details using Discord's rich presence.
      <br/><br/>A very simple project, but I am still proud of it.
      <br/>The code for it is not great and needs to be reworked, but it works.

    <h1 class="display-4">Friday Night Bloxxin'</h1>
    <p class="lead">A Roblox game I worked on for almost a year during 2022-2023.
      <br/>I was the lead developer of the game, and I was responsible for the game's code.
      <br/><br/>The game is a rhythm game, where the player has to hit the correct notes at the correct time.
      <br/>The game was based on the popular rhythm game Friday Night Funkin', and is still in active development.

    <h1 class="display-4">Friday Night Funkin' VS. Camellia</h1>
    <p class="lead">A Friday Night Funkin' project I used to lead in 2021-2022.
      <br/>The mod was based on the musician Camellia, and was made using Kade Engine.
      <br/><br/>I was the lead developer of the mod, and I was responsible for the mod's code.
      <br/>I left the project in 2022, and the project is now maintained by a different team.
