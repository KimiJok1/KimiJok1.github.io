    <h3 class="display-4">Untitled C++ based rhythm game</h3>
    <p class="lead">A project made for Tredu in 2022-2023.
      <br />Made using SDL2 and SDL_GPU, made within a few months without any prior experience in C++.
      <br />The game is a rhythm game, where the player has to hit the correct notes at the correct time.
      <br /><br />I did not have a lot of time to implement all the features I wanted, but I am still proud of the
      result.
      <br />Game is also surprisingly well optimized, although for some reason struggles on NVIDIA GPUs.

    <p class="lead">A Friday Night Funkin' project I used to lead in 2021-2022.
      <br />The mod was based on the musician Camellia, and was made using Kade Engine.
      <br /><br />I was the lead developer of the mod, and I was responsible for the mod's code.
      <br />I left the project in 2022, and the project is now maintained by a different team.

    <h3 class="display-4">Friday Night Bloxxin'</h3>
    <p class="lead">A Roblox game I worked on for almost a year during 2022-2023.
      <br />I was the lead developer of the game, and I was responsible for the game's code.
      <br /><br />The game is a rhythm game, where the player has to hit the correct notes at the correct time.
      <br />The game was based on the popular rhythm game Friday Night Funkin', and has been dead since mid 2024.

    <h3 class="display-4">Project: Afternight</h3>
    <p class="lead">A Roblox game I worked on from Summer 2023 to January 2025.
      <br />I was one of the lead developers for the game, managing backend & song features. 
      <br />I also designed the UI for the game (pre-April 2025 update).
      <br /><br />The game was based on the popular rhythm game Friday Night Funkin' similarly to Friday Night Bloxxin.
      <br />It is still in active development, and gets updated, however I am no longer involved in said project.
